### Hi there, I'm Jessie!

I'm passionate about building and maintaining homelabs, as well as working on exciting Angular/React projects.

Currently, I'm actively learning and expanding my skill set. I have a constant thirst for knowledge and I've been immersing myself in DevOps classes, focusing on Ansible and Terraform. Additionally, I've been actively involved in developing Angular projects.

I'm open to collaborations on various backend projects, specifically in technologies like Quarkus, Node.js, and Flutter.

You can reach me at jessiesmith@absenthome.com. Feel free to get in touch—I'm always eager to connect, explore new opportunities, and satisfy my thirst for knowledge!
